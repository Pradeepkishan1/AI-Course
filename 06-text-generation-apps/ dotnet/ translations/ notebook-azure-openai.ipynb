    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"You've seen so far through this curriculum that there are core concepts like prompts and even a whole discipline called \\\"prompt engineering\\\". Many tools you can interact with like ChatGPT, Office 365, Microsoft Power Platform and more, support you using prompts to accomplish something.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"For you to add such an experience to an app, you need to understand concepts like prompts, completions and choose a library to work with. That's exactly what you'll learn in this chapter.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Introduction\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"In this chapter, you will:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Learn about the openai library and it's core concepts.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Build a text generation app using openai.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Understand how to use concepts like prompt, temperature, and tokens to build a text generation app.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Learning goals\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"At the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Explain what a text generation app is.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Build a text generation app using openai.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Configure your app to use more or less tokens and also change the temperature, for a varied output.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## What is a text generation app?\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Normally when you build an app it has some kind of interface like the following:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Command-based. Console apps are typical apps where you type a command and it carries out a task. For example, `git` is a command-based app.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- User interface (UI). Some apps have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where you click buttons, input text, select options and more.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### Console and UI apps are limited\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Compare it to a command-based app where you type a command: \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **It's limited**. You can't just type any command, only the ones that the app supports.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **Language specific**. Some apps support many languages, but by default the app is built for a specific language, even if you can add more language support. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### Benefits of text generation apps\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"So how is a text generation app different?\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"In a text generation app, you have more flexibility, you're not limited to a set of commands or a specific input language. Instead, you can use natural language to interact with the app. Another benefit is that because you're already interacting with a data source that has been trained on a vast corpus of information, whereas a traditional app might be limited on what's in a database. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### What can I build with a text generation app?\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"There are many things you can build. For example:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **A chatbot**. A chatbot answering questions about topics, like your company and its products could be a good match.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **Helper**. LLMs are great at things like summarizing text, getting insights from text, producing text like resumes and more.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **Code assistant**. Depending on the language model you use, you can build a code assistant that helps you write code. For example, you can use a product like GitHub Copilot as well as ChatGPT to help you write code.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## How can I get started?\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Well, you need to find a way to integrate with an LLM which usually entails the following two approaches:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Use an API. Here you're constructing web requests with your prompt and get generated text back.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Use a library. Libraries help encapsulate the API calls and make them easier to use.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Libraries/SDKs\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"There are a few well known libraries for working with LLMs like:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **openai**, this library makes it easy to connect to your model and send in prompts.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Then there are libraries that operate on a higher level like:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **Langchain**. Langchain is well known and supports Python.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **Semantic Kernel**. Semantic Kernel is a library by Microsoft supporting the languages C#, Python, and Java.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## First app using openai\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Let's see how we can build our first app, what libraries we need, how much is required and so on.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### Install openai\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"There are many libraries out there for interacting with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. It's possible to use numerous programming languages as well like C#, Python, JavaScript, Java and more.  We've chosen to use the `openai` Python library, so we'll use `pip` to install it.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"### Locate API key and endpoint\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"At this point, you need to tell your `openai` library what API key to use. To find your API key, go to \\\"Keys and Endpoint\\\" section of your Azure Open AI resource and copy the \\\"Key 1\\\" value.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"> [!NOTE]\\n\",\n",
    "    \"> It's worth separating your API key from your code. You can do so by using environment variables.\\n\",\n",

    "    \">  `export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'`\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",

    "    \"### Setup configuration Azure\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"If you're using Azure Open AI, here's how you setup configuration:\\n\",\n",

    "    \"Above we're setting the following:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `api_type` to `azure`. This tells the library to use Azure Open AI and not OpenAI.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `api_key`, this is your API key found in the Azure Portal.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `api_version`, this is the version of the API you want to use. At the time of writing, the latest version is `2023-05-15`.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `api_base`, this is the endpoint of the API. You can find it in the Azure Portal next to your API key. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"> [!NOTE]\\n\",\n",
    "    \"> `os.getenv` is a function that reads environment variables. You can use it to read environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `API_BASE`. Set these environment variables in your terminal or by using a library like `dotenv`.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Generate text\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"The way to generate text is to use the `Completion` class. Here's an example:\\n\",\n",

    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"So far, you've seen how we've been using `Completion` to generate text. But there's another class called `ChatCompletion` that is more suited for chatbots. Here's an example of using it:\\n\",\n",

    "    \"```python\\n\",\n",
